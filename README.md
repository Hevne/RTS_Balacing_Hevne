# Units Balacing

Units and unit management are one of the core components of any RTS video game. To make the combat in RTS games engaging, it is important to have a balanced roster of units. Without a good unit balance, the strategy part of a real time strategy game would fall flat, and the game would not feel as a strategy game, but something like a construction simulation game with units that eliminate each other.

## Intransitive Mechanics or Rock Paper Scissors (RPS)

Intransitive Mechanics is just a geeky way of saying "Rock-Paper-Scissors like game" these are the games which don't have a single dominant strategy, because everything is weak and strong at the same time against something else.

We see intransitive mechanics in games all the time. In fighting games, a typical pattern is that normal attacks are defeated by blocks, blocks are defeated by throws, and throws are defeated by attacks. In real-time strategy games, a typical pattern is that you have fliers that can destroy infantry, infantry that works well against archers, and archers are great at bringing down fliers.

Some of these relationships might not be immediately obvious. For example, consider a game where one kind of unit has long-range attacks, which is defeated by a short-range attacker who can turn invisible; this in turn is defeated by a medium-range attacker with radar that reveals invisible units; and the medium-range attacker is of course weak against the long-range attacker.
